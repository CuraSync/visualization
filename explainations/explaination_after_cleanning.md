**Platelet Count:**

Think of platelets as tiny repair workers in your blood. Their main job is to help your blood clot, which stops you from bleeding too much when you get a cut or injury. When you get wounded platelets will rush to the injure place and help to stop bleeding. A normal platelet count is important for healthy blood clotting.

Your platelet count is **380**. This number represents how many platelets you have in a specific amount of your blood. The report also gives you some "average" numbers to compare it to:

*   **World Average:** 300
*   **Sri Lankan Average:** 305
*   **Male Average:** 310
*   **Average for people under 40:** 295

It's important to understand that these "averages" are just that â€“ averages. They represent the typical platelet count found in large groups of people. Your count can be slightly higher or lower than these averages and still be perfectly healthy. In your case, your platelet count is a bit higher than all the averages provided. A slightly elevated platelet count is not always a cause for concern. It can be due to various reasons, such as:

*   **Inflammation:** Your body might be fighting off a minor infection or dealing with some inflammation.
*   **Recent injury or surgery:** Your body might be producing more platelets to help with healing.
*   **Iron deficiency:** Sometimes, low iron levels can lead to a higher platelet count.
*   **Certain medications:** Some drugs can affect platelet production.

However, it's essential to discuss this with your doctor. They will consider your overall health, medical history, and other test results to determine if further investigation is needed. Very high platelet counts can sometimes indicate an underlying problem, but in many cases, a slightly elevated count is nothing to worry about.

**White Cell Count:**

White blood cells (also called leukocytes) are the soldiers of your immune system. They are responsible to fight against the disease and infection. White blood cells protect us from getting sick. There are different types of white blood cells, each with a specific role in defending your body against infections, viruses, and other threats.

Your white cell count is **4.9**. This number tells us how many white blood cells you have in a specific amount of your blood. Like with platelets, the report gives you some "average" numbers for comparison:

*   **World Average:** 300
*   **Sri Lankan Average:** 305
*   **Male Average:** 310
*   **Average for people under 40:** 295

**Important Note:** The average numbers provided for the white cell count seem unusually high and likely contain an error. Typical white blood cell counts are much lower than the values listed. A normal white blood cell count usually falls between 4.0 and 11.0. Based on this more accurate range, your white cell count of 4.9 appears to be within the normal range.

A white cell count within the normal range generally indicates that your immune system is functioning properly. However, it's still important to discuss your results with your doctor. They can provide personalized advice based on your individual health needs and circumstances.

**In Summary:**

Your platelet count is slightly elevated compared to the provided averages, while your white cell count appears to be within the normal range (assuming the provided average data for white cell count is incorrect). It's
